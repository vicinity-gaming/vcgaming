         * This is a retarded way to implement event XP (or other kinds of XP rates for that matter) but the reason for
         * this implementation is that when issuing XP in the run() method defined below there is no access to the type
         * of log for which XP is to be issued. The only data available is the amount of time a person has spent in voice.
         *
         * However, here in preQueueData() when the amount of time between two logs is calculated we have got the
         * VoiceLog object to work with and, therefore we have got access to the type of log and associated XP rate.
         *
         * If we calculate the ratio between the events XP rate and the standard XP rate we can multiply the time by
         * the ratio before adding to the total. This accounts for the time always being multiplied by the standard XP
         * rate.
         *
         * As to why this is utterly retarded; this is a convoluted solution and, it relies on the standard XP rate to
         * never be zero otherwise we would be multiplying the time by \INF which when cast to an integer value as it
         * would be when inserted in the database or converted into JSON, it would be equal to zero.
